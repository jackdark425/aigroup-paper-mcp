          "title": "Detecting Botnet Attacks in IoT Environments: An Optimized Machine Learning Approach",
          "abstract": "The increased reliance on the Internet and the corresponding surge in connectivity demand has led to a significant growth in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The continued deployment of IoT devices has in turn led to an increase in network attacks due to the larger number of potential attack surfaces as illustrated by the recent reports that IoT malware attacks increased by 215.7% from 10.3 million in 2017 to 32.7 million in 2018. This illustrates the increased vulnerability and susceptibility of IoT devices and networks. Therefore, there is a need for proper effective and efficient attack detection and mitigation techniques in such environments. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as one potential solution due to the abundance of data generated and available for IoT devices and networks. Hence, they have significant potential to be adopted for intrusion detection for IoT environments. To that end, this paper proposes an optimized ML-based framework consisting of a combination of Bayesian optimization Gaussian Process (BO-GP) algorithm and decision tree (DT) classification model to detect attacks on IoT devices in an effective and efficient manner. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using the Bot-IoT-2018 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed optimized framework has a high detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for the detection of botnet attacks in IoT environments.",

          "abstract": "Clinical coding is an administrative process that involves the translation of diagnostic data from episodes of care into a standard code format such as ICD10. It has many critical applications such as billing and aetiology research. The automation of clinical coding is very challenging due to data sparsity, low interoperability of digital health systems, complexity of real-life diagnosis coupled with the huge size of ICD10 code space. Related work suffer from low applicability due to reliance on many data sources, inefficient modelling and less generalizable solutions. We propose a novel collaborative residual learning based model to automatically predict ICD10 codes employing only prescriptions data. Extensive experiments were performed on two real-world clinical datasets (outpatient & inpatient) from Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital with real case-mix distributions. We obtain multi-label classification accuracy of 0.71 and 0.57 of average precision, 0.57 and 0.38 of F1-score and 0.73 and 0.44 of accuracy in predicting principal diagnosis for inpatient and outpatient datasets respectively.",

          "abstract": "The increased reliance on the Internet and the corresponding surge in connectivity demand has led to a significant growth in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The continued deployment of IoT devices has in turn led to an increase in network attacks due to the larger number of potential attack surfaces as illustrated by the recent reports that IoT malware attacks increased by 215.7% from 10.3 million in 2017 to 32.7 million in 2018. This illustrates the increased vulnerability and susceptibility of IoT devices and networks. Therefore, there is a need for proper effective and efficient attack detection and mitigation techniques in such environments. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as one potential solution due to the abundance of data generated and available for IoT devices and networks. Hence, they have significant potential to be adopted for intrusion detection for IoT environments. To that end, this paper proposes an optimized ML-based framework consisting of a combination of Bayesian optimization Gaussian Process (BO-GP) algorithm and decision tree (DT) classification model to detect attacks on IoT devices in an effective and efficient manner. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using the Bot-IoT-2018 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed optimized framework has a high detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for the detection of botnet attacks in IoT environments.",

It has many critical applications such as billing and aetiology research. The automation of clinical coding is very challenging due to data sparsity, low interoperability of digital health systems, complexity of real-life diagnosis coupled with the huge size of ICD10 code space. Related work suffer from low applicability due to reliance on many data sources, inefficient modelling and less generalizable solutions. We propose a novel collaborative residual learning based model to automatically predict ICD10 codes employing only prescriptions data. Extensive experiments were performed on two real-world clinical datasets (outpatient & inpatient) from Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital with real case-mix distributions. We obtain multi-label classification accuracy of 0.71 and 0.57 of average precision, 0.57 and 0.38 of F1-score and 0.73 and 0.44 of accuracy in predicting principal diagnosis for inpatient and outpatient datasets respectively.",

Currently, coding is a manual effort while the automation of such task is not straight forward. Among the challenges are the messy and noisy clinical records, case complexities, along with the huge ICD10 code space. Previous work mainly relied on discharge notes for prediction and was applied to a very limited data scale. We propose an ensemble model incorporating multiple clinical data sources for accurate code predictions. We further propose an assessment mechanism to provide confidence rates in predicted outcomes. Extensive experiments were performed on two new real-world clinical datasets (inpatient & outpatient) with unaltered case-mix distributions from Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital. We obtain multi-label classification accuracies of 0.73 and 0.58 for average precision, 0.56 and 0.35 for F1-scores and 0.71 and 0.4 accuracy in predicting principal diagnosis for inpatient and outpatient datasets respectively.",
